# Circuits for zkEVM

This is the zkEVM circuits used in Scroll Mainnet. It was forked from PSE zkevm-circuits and added a lot of new features later:

1. SHA256 / MODEXP / EC precompiles
2. RLP circuit / MPT circuit / Poseidon circuit
3. multi block chunking
4. proof aggregation
5. [>99.5% compatibility](https://circuit-release.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/testool/nightly.1695216104.47e2015.html) with [official EVM test vector](https://github.com/ethereum/tests)
6. Many optimizations like read/write memory in word instead of byte

## Getting started

We recommend developers to go to our [circuit playground repo](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-prover) for a detailed step-by-step guide on how to run proving.

## Project Layout

This repository contains several Rust packages that implement the zkevm. The high-level structure of the repository is as follows:

[`bus-mapping`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/bus-mapping)

- a crate designed to parse EVM execution traces and manipulate all of the data they provide in order to obtain structured witness inputs for circuits.

[`circuit-benchmarks`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/circuit-benchmarks)

- (Deprecated) Measures performance of each circuit based on proving and verifying time and execution trace parsing and generation for each subcircuit

[`eth-types`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/eth-types)

- Different types helpful for various components of the EVM

[`external-tracer`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/external-tracer)

- Generates traces by connecting to an locally linked Geth EVM tracer

[`gadgets`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/gadgets)

- Custom circuits that abstracts away low-level circuit detail.
- [What are gadgets?](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/concepts/gadgets.html)

[`geth-utils`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/geth-utils)

- Provides output from geth tracing APIs as circuit inputs

[`integration-tests`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/integration-tests)

- Integration tests for all circuits

[`keccak`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/blob/develop/zkevm-circuits/src/keccak_circuit.rs)

- (Deprecated) Modules for Keccak hash circuit

[`mock`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/mock)

- Testing module. Mock definitions and methods that are used to test circuits or opcodes

[`testool`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/testool)

- Parser and driver of official Ethereum Execution Tests

[`zkevm-circuits`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/zkevm-circuits/src)

- Main package that contains all circuit logic

[`zktrie`](https://github.com/scroll-tech/zkevm-circuits/tree/develop/zktrie)

- Wrapper of scroll binary poseidon trie
