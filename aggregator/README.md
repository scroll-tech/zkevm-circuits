# Structs

## Chunk

A __chunk__ is a list of continuous blocks. It consists of 4 hashes:
- state root before this chunk
- state root after this chunk
- the withdraw root of this chunk
- the data hash of this chunk

Those 4 hashes are obtained from the caller.

The chunk's public input hash is 
```
chunk_pi_hash := keccak(chain_id || prev_state_root || post_state_root || withdraw_root ||  chunk_data_hash)
```

## Continuous chunks

A list of continuous chunks $c_1, \dots, c_k$ satisfy
```
c_i.post_state_root == c_{i+1}.prev_state_root
```
for $i \in [1, k-1]$.

## Padded chunk
A __padded chunk__ is a chunk that repeats the last valid chunk. It is used for padding. 
If $k< n$, $(n-k)$ padded chunks are padded to the list. A padded chunk has the same data fields as the last real chunk, and the parameters are set as
- state root before this chunk: `c_{k}.prev_state_root`
- state root after this chunk: `c_{k}.post_state_root`
- the withdraw root of this chunk: `c_{k}.withdraw_root`
- the data hash of this chunk: `c_{k}.data_hash`

## Batch

A __batch__ consists of continuous chunks of size `k`. If the input chunks' size `k` is less than `n`, we pad the input with `(n-k)` chunks identical to `chunk[k]`.

# Circuits

## Chunk circuit

Circuit proving the relationship for a chunk is indeed the zkEVM circuit. It will go through 2 layers of compression circuit, and becomes a __snark__ struct. We do not list its details here. Abstractly, a snark circuit has the following properties:
- it takes 44 elements as public inputs 
    - 12 from accumulators
    - 32 from public input hash

## Aggregation Circuit

We want to aggregate `k` snarks, each from a valid chunk. We generate `(n-k)` padded chunks, and obtain a total of `n` snarks. 

In the above example, we have `k = 2` valid chunks, and `2` padded chunks.

The padded snarks are identical the the last valid snark, so the aggregator does not need to generate snarks for padded chunks.

### Configuration

There will be three configurations for Aggregation circuit.
- FpConfig; used for snark aggregation
- KeccakConfig: used to build keccak table
- RlcConfig: used to compute RLC of hash inputs

### Public Input
The public input of the aggregation circuit consists of
- 12 elements from accumulator
- 32 elements of `batch_pi_hash`

### Statements
For snarks $s_1,\dots,s_k,\dots, s_n$ the aggregation circuit argues the following statements.

1. batch_data_hash digest is reused for public input hash. __Static__.

2. batch_pi_hash used same roots as chunk_pi_hash. __Static__.
```
batch_pi_hash   := keccak(chain_id || chunk_1.prev_state_root || chunk_n.post_state_root || chunk_n.withdraw_root || batch_data_hash)
```
and `batch_pi_hash` matches public input.

3. batch_data_hash and chunk[i].pi_hash use a same chunk[i].data_hash when chunk[i] is not padded

```
for i in 1 ... n
    chunk_pi_hash   := keccak(chain_id || prev_state_root || post_state_root || withdraw_root || chunk_data_hash)
```

This is done by computing the RLCs of chunk[i]'s data_hash for `i=0..k`, and then check the RLC matches the one from the keccak table.

4. chunks are continuous when they are not padded: they are linked via the state roots.

```
for i in 1 ... k-1
    c_i.post_state_root == c_{i+1}.prev_state_root
```

5. All the chunks use the same chain id. __Static__.
```
for i in 1 ... n
    batch.chain_id == chunk[i].chain_id
```

6. The last `(n-k)` chunk[i] are padding
```
for i in 1 ... n:
    if is_padding:
        chunk[i]'s chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells == chunk[i-1].chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells
```
This is done via comparing the `data_rlc` of `chunk_{i-1}` and ` chunk_{i}`.
7. the hash input length is correct
- first MAX_AGG_SNARKS + 1 hashes all have 136 bytes input
- batch's data_hash length is 32 * number_of_valid_snarks
8. batch data hash is correct w.r.t. its RLCs
9. is_final_cells are set correctly

### Handling dynamic inputs


![Dynamic_inputs](./figures/hash_table.jpg)


Our keccak table uses $2^{19}$ rows. Each keccak round takes `300` rows. When the number of round is less than $2^{19}/300$, the cell manager will fill in the rest of the rows with dummy hashes. 

The only hash that uses a dynamic number of rounds is the last hash. 
Suppose we target for `MAX_AGG_SNARK = 10`. Then, the last hash function will take no more than `32 * 10 /136 = 3` rounds. 

We also know in the circuit if a chunk is an empty one or not. This is given by a flag `is_padding`. 

For the input of the final data hash
- we extract `32 * MAX_AGG_SNARK` number of cells (__static__ here) from the last hash. We then compute the RLC of those `32 * MAX_AGG_SNARK` when the corresponding `is_padding` is not set. We constrain this RLC match the `data_rlc` from the keccak table.

For the output of the final data hash
- we extract all three hash digest cells from the last 3 rounds. We then constraint that the actual data hash matches one of the three hash digest cells with proper flags defined as follows.
    - if the num_of_valid_snarks <= 4, which only needs 1 keccak-f round. Therefore the batch's data hash (input, len, data_rlc, output_rlc) is in the first 300 keccak rows;
    - else if the num_of_valid_snarks <= 8, which needs 2 keccak-f rounds. Therefore the batch's data hash (input, len, data_rlc, output_rlc) is in the 2nd 300 keccak rows;
    - else the num_of_valid_snarks <= 12, which needs 3 keccak-f rounds. Therefore the batch's data hash (input, len, data_rlc, output_rlc) is in the 3rd 300 keccak rows;

|#valid snarks | offset of data hash | flags|
|---| ---| ---|
|1,2,3,4       | 0                   | 1, 0, 0|
|5,6,7,8       | 32                  | 0, 1, 0   |
|9,10          | 64                  | 0, 0, 1|

Additional checks for dummy chunk
- if `is_padding` for `i`-th chunk, we constrain `chunk[i]'s chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells == chunk[i-1].chunk_pi_hash_rlc_cells`
